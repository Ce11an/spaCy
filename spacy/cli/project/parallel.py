"""
Permits the execution of a parallel command group.

The main process starts a worker process for each spaCy projects command in the parallel group.
Each spaCy projects command consists of n OS level commands. The worker process starts
subprocesses for these OS level commands serially, and sends status information about their
execution back to the main process.

The main process maintains a state machine for each spaCy projects command/worker process. The meaning
of the states is documented alongside the _ParallelCommandInfo.STATES code. Note that the distinction
between the states 'failed' and 'terminated' is not meaningful on Windows, so that both are displayed
as 'failed/terminated' on Windows systems.
